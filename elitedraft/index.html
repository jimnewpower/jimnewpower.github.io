      <h3>The essential tool for your home draft...since 2010</h3>

      <p>During your draft, view player stats, bye weeks, adp, current adp value, auction value, and more; you may set up a player queue, view cheat sheet by all players or by position, view draft results by round or by team, and sort player list multiple ways.
